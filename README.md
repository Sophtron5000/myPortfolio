## Welcome Potential Employers 

This is my developer portfolio, Sophia Custodia. It showcases my recent projects and links for potential employers to try out. I also includes my resume, contact information, and my photo. 

The technology used was HTML and advanced CSS, utilizing flexboxes. Html was used to build the basic outline of my portfolio, the document includes semantic HTML and detailed content within. The HTML document is linked to a reset.css and a style.css. The purpose for the reset.css is to reset any browsers default css elements, allowing any browser to style according to the included style.css. 
Css was used to style my portfolio. Css selectors were used to incorporate a universal color palette and font styling. I used flexboxes to organize content within the INDEX.HTML and create a more dynamic feel to the page.
Media queries  were used to ensure my portfolio displays well on smaller screens.  
My greatest challenge while building this project was the flexboxes and playing with their layout. I hope to implement more in the future. Perseverance payed off and I am pleased with what I have to provide you; a launchpad to future my new career as a full stack developer!
